# Example Questions for AWS Certified Security Specialty Exam

### Amazon S3 - Your company requires that all data sent to external storage be encrypted before being sent. Which Amazon S3 encryption solution will meet this requirement?

```
1. Server-side Encryption with AWS-managed keys (SSE-S3)
>> 2. Server-side Encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C)
3. Client-side Encryption with customer-managed keys
4. Server-side Encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS)
```

### Geo Blocking - Your company is running a gaming server in India. The service receives and processes UDP requests on port 27015. The server has started receiving DDoS attacks from outside of India on that port. Which service can be used to block non-Indian UDP traffic?

```
1. Amazon CloudFront with Geo Restrictions
2. AWS WAF Geographic Match
3. Amazon VPC Security Groups
>> 4. The gaming service will need to block the traffic itself
```

* CloudFront only works with HTTP traffic (application layer 7), not UDP traffic (transport layer 4).
* WAF only works with HTTP traffic (application layer 7).
* VPC Security Groups doesn't address DDoS attacks directly i.e. is not the best solution.

### Amazon VPC - You notice significant traffic coming from an IP address in a foreign country in which your company does not have customers. Further investigation indicates that the source of the traffic is scanning for open ports on your Amazon EC2 instances. Which of the following can DENY THE TRAFFIC from reaching the instance?

```
1. Security Group
>> 2. Network ACL
3. NAT Gateway
4. AWS Global Accelerator
```

Only Network ACL can deny a particular IP address.

###  KMS - A corporate cloud security policy states that communication between the company's VPC and KMS must travel entirely within the AWS network and not use public service endpoints. Which combination of the following actions MOST satisfies this requirement? (Select TWO.)

```
>> A) Add the aws:sourceVpce condition to the AWS KMS key policy referencing the company's VPC
endpoint ID.
B) Remove the VPC internet gateway from the VPC and add a virtual private gateway to the VPC to prevent
direct, public internet connectivity.
>> C) Create a VPC endpoint for AWS KMS with private DNS enabled.
D) Use the KMS Import Key feature to securely transfer the AWS KMS key over a VPN.
E) Add the following condition to the AWS KMS key policy: "aws:SourceIp": "10.0.0.0/16".
```

__Explanation__

A Key Policy can deny access to AWS KMS except through your VPC endpoint.

Example Key Policy: _allow all users in account "111222333" to access CMKs only via. VPC endpoint (VPC endpoint ID) "vpce-1234abcdf5678c90a"._

```json
"Statement": [
    {
        "Sid": "Restrict usage to my VPC endpoint",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {"AWS":["111222333"]},
        "Action": ["kms:*"],
        "Resource": "*",
        "Condition": {
            "StringNotEquals": {
                "aws:sourceVpce": "vpce-1234abcdf5678c90a"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

If you select the Enable Private DNS Name option, the standard AWS KMS DNS hostname _https://kms.<region>.amazonaws.com_ resolves to your VPC endpoint.

### CloudWatch - An application team is designing a solution with two applications. The security team wants the applications' logs to be captured in two different places, because one of the applications produces logs with sensitive data. Which solution meets the requirement with the LEAST risk and effort?

```
A) Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to capture all logs, write an AWS Lambda function that parses the log
file, and move sensitive data to a different log.
>> B) Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs with two log groups, with one for each application, and use an AWS IAM
policy to control access to the log groups, as required.
C) Aggregate logs into one file, then use Amazon CloudWatch Logs, and then design two CloudWatch
metric filters to filter sensitive data from the logs.
D) Add logic to the application that saves sensitive data logs on the Amazon EC2 instances' local storage,
and write a batch script that logs into the Amazon EC2 instances and moves sensitive logs to a secure
location.
```

Each application's log can be configured to send the log to a specific Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group.


### Security Groups - A security engineer must set up security group rules for a three-tier application. Which combination of the following security group rules will allow the application to be secure and functional? (Select THREE.)

1. Presentation tier – Accessed by users over the web, protected by the security group `presentation-sg`
2. Logic tier – RESTful API accessed from the presentation tier through HTTPS, protected by the security group `logic-sg`
3. Data tier – SQL Server database accessed over port 1433 from the logic tier, protected by the security group `data-sg`

```
>> A) presentation-sg: Allow ports 80 and 443 from 0.0.0.0/0
B) data-sg: Allow port 1433 from presentation-sg
>> C) data-sg: Allow port 1433 from logic-sg
D) presentation-sg: Allow port 1433 from data-sg
>> E) logic-sg: Allow port 443 from presentation-sg
F) logic-sg: Allow port 443 from 0.0.0.0/0
```

In an n-tier architecture, each tier's security group allows traffic from the security group sending it traffic only. The presentation tier opens traffic for HTTP and HTTPS from the internet. Since security groups are stateful, only inbound rules are required.


### Amazon Cognito - A security engineer is working with a product team building a web application on AWS. The application uses Amazon S3 to host the static content, Amazon API Gateway to provide RESTful services, and Amazon DynamoDB as the backend data store. The users already exist in a directory that is exposed through a SAML identity provider. Which combination of the following actions should the engineer take to enable users to be authenticated into the web application and call APIs? (Select THREE).

```
A) Create a custom authorization service using AWS Lambda.
>> B) Configure a SAML identity provider in Amazon Cognito to map attributes to the Amazon Cognito user
pool attributes.
>> C) Configure the SAML identity provider to add the Amazon Cognito user pool as a relying party.
D) Configure an Amazon Cognito identity pool to integrate with social login providers.
E) Update DynamoDB to store the user email addresses and passwords.
>> F) Update API Gateway to use an Amazon Cognito user pool authorizer.
```

__Explanation__

When Amazon Cognito receives a SAML assertion, it needs to be able to __map SAML attributes to User Pool attributes__.

When configuring Amazon Cognito to receive SAML assertions from an identity provider, you need to ensure that the identity provider is configured to have Amazon Cognito as a __relying party__. _A SAML Relying Party is any system that receives and accepts information from another system e.g. Amazon Cognito_.

F: API Gateway will need to be able to understand the authorization being passed from Amazon Cognito, which is a configuration step - update API Gateway to use an __Amazon Cognito User Pool Authorizer__.


### S3 Bucket Policy - A company is hosting a web application on AWS and is using an Amazon S3 bucket to store images. Users should have the ability to read objects in the bucket. A security engineer has written the following bucket policy to grant public read access. Attempts to read an object, however, receive the error: "Action does not apply to any resource(s) in statement.” What should the engineer do to fix the error?

```json
{
    "ID":"Policy1502987489630",
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement":[
        {
            "Sid":"Stmt1502987487640",
            "Action":[
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:GetObjectVersion"
        ],
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::appbucket",
            "Principal":"*"
        }
    ]
}
```

```
A) Change the IAM permissions by applying PutBucketPolicy permissions.
B) Verify that the policy has the same name as the bucket name. If not, make it the same.
>> C) Change the resource section to "arn:aws:s3:::appbucket/*".
D) Add an s3:ListBucket action. 
```

__Explanation__

The `resource` section should match with the type of operation. Change the ARN to include `/*` at the end as it is an __object operation__.


### VPC Peering - A company decides to place database hosts in its own VPC, and to set up VPC peering to different VPCs containing the application and web tiers. The application servers are unable to connect to the database. Which network troubleshooting steps should be taken to resolve the issue? (Select TWO.)

```
A) Check to see if the application servers are in a private subnet or public subnet.
>> B) Check the route tables for the application server subnets for routes to the VPC peering connection.
C) Check the NACLs for the database subnets for rules that allow traffic from the internet.
>> D) Check the database security groups for rules that allow traffic from the application servers.
E) Check to see if the database VPC has an internet gateway
```

__Explanation__

You must __configure the Route Tables__ in each VPC to route to each other through a peering connection.

You must also __add rules to the Security Group__ for the database to accept requests from the application server in the other VPC.


### CloudWatch Logging - When testing a new AWS Lambda function that retrieves items from an Amazon DynamoDB table, the security engineer notices that the function was not logging any data to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. The following policy was assigned to the role assumed by the Lambda function.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Dynamo-1234567",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:GetItem"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Which least-privilege policy addition would allow this function to log properly?

Policy A
```json
{
    "Sid": "Logging-12345",
    "Resource": "*",
    "Action": [
        "logs:*"
    ],
    "Effect": "Allow"
}
```

Policy B
```json
{
    "Sid": "Logging-12345",
    "Resource": "*",
    "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogStream"
    ],
    "Effect": "Allow"
}
```

>> Policy C
```json
{
    "Sid": "Logging-12345",
    "Resource": "*",
    "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
    ],
    "Effect": "Allow"
}
```

Policy D
```json
{
    "Sid": "Logging-12345",
    "Resource": "*",
    "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:DeleteLogGroup",
        "logs:DeleteLogStream",
        "logs:getLogEvents",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
    ],
    "Effect": "Allow"
}
```

__Explanation__

Basic Lambda permissions required to log to Amazon CloudWatch Logs include `CreateLogGroup`, `CreateLogStream` and `PutLogEvents`.


###  A company is building a data lake on Amazon S3. The data consists of millions of small files containing sensitive information. The security team has the following requirements for the architecture:
1. Data must be encrypted in transit.
2. Data must be encrypted at rest.
3. The bucket must be private, but if the bucket is accidentally made public, the data must remain confidential.

Which combination of steps would meet the requirements? (Select TWO.)

```
A) Enable AES-256 encryption using server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) on the S3 bucket.
>> B) Enable default encryption with server-side encryption with AWS KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS) on the S3 bucket.
>> C) Add a bucket policy that includes a deny if a PutObject request does not include aws:SecureTransport.
D) Add a bucket policy with aws:SourceIp to allow uploads and downloads from the corporate intranet only.
E) Enable Amazon Macie to monitor and act on changes to the data lake's S3 bucket.
```

__Explanation__

Sever-side encryption with SSE-KMS will provide protection against:
* __Physical disks being stolen__ - bucket has server-side encryption (_SSE-S3 also provides this_)
* __Accidental public exposure__ - the AWS-managed CMK would have privileges from Key Policy or IAM Policy that prevent users outside of AWS to access the key to decrypt the bucket (_SSE-S3 does NOT provide this_)

HTTPS will protect data in transit.


### A security engineer must ensure that all API calls are collected across all company accounts, and that they are preserved online and are instantly available for analysis for 90 days. For compliance reasons, this data must be restorable for 7 years. Which steps must be taken to meet the retention needs in a scalable, cost-effective way?

```
A) Enable AWS CloudTrail logging across all accounts to a centralized Amazon S3 bucket with versioning
enabled. Set a lifecycle policy to move the data to Amazon Glacier daily, and expire the data after 90
days.
B) Enable AWS CloudTrail logging across all accounts to S3 buckets. Set a lifecycle policy to expire the data
in each bucket after 7 years.
C) Enable AWS CloudTrail logging across all accounts to Amazon Glacier. Set a lifecycle policy to expire the
data after 7 years.
>> D) Enable AWS CloudTrail logging across all accounts to a centralized Amazon S3 bucket. Set a lifecycle
policy to move the data to Amazon Glacier after 90 days, and expire the data after 7 years.
```

__Explanation__

Use S3 Object Lifecycle Management to remove the files after the required 90 days period of time and then move files to AWS Glacier for more cost-effective long-term storage for the 7-year requirement.


### A security engineer has been informed that a user’s access key has been found on GitHub. The engineer must ensure that this access key cannot continue to be used, and must assess whether the access key was used to perform any unauthorized activities. Which steps must be taken to perform these tasks?

```
A) Review the user's IAM permissions and delete any unrecognized or unauthorized resources.
B) Delete the user, review Amazon CloudWatch Logs in all regions, and report the abuse.
>> C) Delete or rotate the user’s key, review the AWS CloudTrail logs in all regions, and delete any
unrecognized or unauthorized resources.
D) Instruct the user to remove the key from the GitHub submission, rotate keys, and re-deploy any instances
that were launched.
```

__Explanation__

C removes keys and audits the environment for malicious activities.
